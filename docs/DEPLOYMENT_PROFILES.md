# BrisaBase Deployment Profiles

BrisaBase uses one application codebase and one public API surface across deployment sizes. Profiles change topology and operational guarantees; they do not change project schemas or SDK contracts.

## CLI-first onboarding

The official `brisabase` command is the recommended entrypoint for deployment profiles and named targets. Repository-maintainer scripts such as `npm run deployment -- ...` and `npm run target -- ...` remain available for compatibility, but user-facing examples use the CLI directly.

For the simplest local path:

```bash
brisabase deployment init hobby
brisabase up
```

`brisabase up` is intentionally a Hobby-only shortcut. Use `brisabase deployment up <profile>` for Self-Hosted or Enterprise so a production topology is always explicit.

## 1. Hobby / Local

Audience: beginners, students, prototypes and personal projects.

Topology:
- BrisaBase API/console in Docker;
- PostgreSQL, Redis, MinIO and Mailpit bundled locally;
- Functions Executor isolated in its own container;
- all host ports bound to `127.0.0.1` by the base local Compose;
- development-only local credentials are never accepted by the production validator.

Start:

```bash
brisabase deployment init hobby
brisabase up
# Equivalent explicit form:
brisabase deployment up hobby
```

The generated `.env.hobby` is intentionally local-only. Do not expose the Hobby stack directly to the internet.

## 2. Self-Hosted

Audience: professional developers, startups and teams running BrisaBase on one VPS or dedicated server.

Topology:
- bundled PostgreSQL, Redis and MinIO;
- Caddy TLS edge;
- isolated Functions execution plane;
- persistent Docker volumes;
- production secrets and immutable dependency images;
- production contract explicitly limited to `single-host`.

Start:

```bash
brisabase deployment init self-hosted
# BrisaBase secrets are generated automatically with independent random values.
# Configure domains and immutable image digests in .env.production.
brisabase deployment doctor self-hosted
brisabase deployment up self-hosted
```

`deployment init` writes the generated production environment with restrictive file permissions where the operating system supports them. It does not print generated secret values to the console.

`BRISABASE_PRODUCTION_TIER=ha` is deliberately rejected for this profile. High availability requires external infrastructure and the Enterprise profile.

## 3. Enterprise / External Infrastructure

Audience: large companies and regulated environments that already operate managed databases, caches, object storage, ingress/WAF and centralized observability.

Topology:
- BrisaBase application container, suitable for replication by the customer's orchestrator;
- a short-lived hardened migration container that receives `DATABASE_MIGRATION_URL`;
- the long-running BrisaBase runtime receives only the lower-privilege `DATABASE_URL`;
- external PostgreSQL over TLS;
- external authenticated Redis over TLS;
- external S3-compatible storage over HTTPS;
- optional external Functions execution service over HTTPS;
- optional bundled Caddy edge (`--profile edge`) or an existing corporate load balancer/WAF;
- `managed` deployment mode and `ha` production tier;
- no bundled PostgreSQL, Redis, MinIO or single-node Functions Executor in `docker-compose.enterprise.yml`.

The Enterprise profile deliberately does not label the single Functions container used by Hobby/Self-Hosted as HA. `FUNCTIONS_ENABLED=false` is the safe default. When a company deploys a replicated Functions plane behind its own internal/public HTTPS service, set:

```bash
FUNCTIONS_ENABLED=true
FUNCTIONS_EXECUTOR_URL=https://functions.example.com
FUNCTIONS_EXECUTOR_TOKEN=<unique-random-secret>
FUNCTIONS_RPC_CALLBACK_ORIGIN=https://brisabase.example.com
```

Start:

```bash
brisabase deployment init enterprise
# BrisaBase-owned secrets are generated automatically.
# Configure PostgreSQL/Redis/S3 credentials, domains and immutable images.
brisabase deployment doctor enterprise
brisabase deployment up enterprise
```

The application credential and migration credential must be different accounts in real enterprise infrastructure. `DATABASE_MIGRATION_URL` is consumed only by the migration service; it is intentionally absent from the application container.

Optional bundled edge:

```bash
docker compose --env-file .env.enterprise -f docker-compose.enterprise.yml --profile edge up -d
```

## Switching a project between local and remote instances

`brisabase.json` contains the API URL used by the CLI. Named targets preserve several safe origins and switch that URL without moving credentials into the target file.

```bash
brisabase target add local http://localhost:3000
brisabase target add empresa https://baas.empresa.com
brisabase target list
brisabase target use empresa
brisabase target doctor empresa
```

Remote targets must use HTTPS. URLs containing usernames, passwords, query strings or fragments are rejected. `brisabase.targets.json` contains only target names and URLs and is ignored by Git so workstation-specific target state is not committed accidentally. The stored admin session remains in the CLI session store.

This supports the intended workflow:

```text
same application + same migrations + same SDK
              │
       ┌──────┴──────┐
       │             │
 localhost       own server
       │             │
       └──── target switch ────┘
```

## Migration path

A team can grow without changing application code:

```text
Hobby / localhost
      ↓
Self-Hosted / one VPS
      ↓
Enterprise / external PostgreSQL + Redis + S3 + ingress
```

Keep the same project IDs, migrations, REST/GraphQL contracts and SDK. Move infrastructure components through supported configuration and controlled backup/restore procedures rather than copying live database files.

## Profile rules

| Control | Hobby | Self-Hosted | Enterprise |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Internet-facing production | No | Yes | Yes |
| Bundled PostgreSQL | Yes | Yes | No |
| Bundled Redis | Yes | Yes | No |
| Bundled MinIO | Yes | Yes | No |
| Bundled Functions executor | Yes | Yes | No; external HTTPS when enabled |
| TLS required | No (loopback) | Yes | Yes |
| Distributed Redis coordination | Local Redis | Bundled Redis | External Redis |
| Migration credential in app runtime | N/A/local | Bundled topology | No; migration service only |
| HA claim | No | No | Yes, infrastructure-dependent |
| Corporate WAF/LB | Optional/not needed | Optional | Recommended |
| External observability | Optional | Optional | Recommended |

## Important distinction: plan vs deployment profile

Commercial tiers (Free/Pro/Team/Enterprise) are billing/entitlement concepts. Deployment profiles (Hobby/Self-Hosted/Enterprise) describe infrastructure topology. Do not infer a commercial entitlement only from the Compose file a customer runs.
